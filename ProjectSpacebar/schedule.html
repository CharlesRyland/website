    <h1>2021</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>December</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Aidan</h3>
    <p>
        Design Payload to fit the necessary equipment to measure altitude and GPS system
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Brian</h3>
    <p>
        Determine how much force is required from each coil to reach our goal of 100,000 meters, and thus how many coils we need
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Charles</h3>
    <p>
        Research and develop the FAA clearance plan. Determine launch location. Start funding plan and get list of materials of what needs to be purchased by the school. Write MIT application   
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Robby</h3>
    <p>
        Create schematics for the mass driver. Work with Brian to determine how many coils are needed
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>2022</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>January</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Aidan</h3>
    <p>
        Design payload structure. Test out payload against high velocities and sudden acceleration to prevent damage to the payload.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Brian</h3>
    <p>
        Determine how much electricity is needed to power the capacitors for the coils  
    </p>
    <br>
