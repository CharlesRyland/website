<h2>This project was inspired by a physics project we were assigned in september of 2021 where we were assigned to take a marble and launch it, then take the initial position and the final position with the time to get the velocity of the projectile. So our group (Jupiter) decided to go above and beyond to use a pnumatic system to launch the marble at supersonic speeds. Below is how we did it.</h2>
