<2>History</2>
<br>
<h3>Sadly there is nothing documented on the MK1 other than it kinda looked like a bomb and it was
    bad. It had all of the problems of the later mk2 and more like the fact that it was a bomb and
    exploded on one of our tests. Without the barrel that was added on the later MK1.1 it could only
    ever move the ball like 18cm. Like the mk1 the mk1.1
    also looked like a bomb and if it wasn't for tech lack of care on things like this we might have
    gone to prison. And much like the MK1 it was a bomb and exploded the day we got it for testing
    in class. But at that time the MK2 had been completed so it was not much of a loss.</h3>
