<h2>So as of making this the MK3 does not exist yet it is still a load of parts in a shed. But it will be a
    beast .We plan to change the pressure tank by making it smaller so we can get more pressure
    and we want to draw the barrel to vacuum to help “suck” the ball out of the barrel. We have also
    made the barrel longer at 91 cm instead of 60 cm. We have an estimated range of 600 meter at
    a 45 degree angle and a speed of mach 1.1. And unlike the MK1, MK1.1,MK2 the MK3 has
    some math to back it up just ignore that it is wrong ok and a schematic on what it should look
    like.</h2>
