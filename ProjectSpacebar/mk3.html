    <h1>The Mark III</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<br>
<h3>The Mark 3 marble launcher was very similar to the Mark 2, however it had a solenoid valve for a quicker release of pressure. Unfortunately experiments could not be performed because on the first shot we lost the marble. Despite this the one time the Mark 3 was operational it did shoot the marble at super sonic speeds.</h3>
