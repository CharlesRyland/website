    <h1>The Mark II</h1>
History</2>
<br>
<h3>The MK2 was the big bother to the MK1 and MK1.1 ti had a 2 foot barrel and a much larger
    pressure chamber, some might have said it was too big hint hint. But the MK2 with its leaks and
    slow valve was still able to push the ball towards mach 1 topping out at an impressive 333.3m/s
    and an impressive distance of 57 meters. Unlike the MK1 and MK1.1 it had notes taken on it.</h3>
