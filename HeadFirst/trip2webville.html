    The book is offering several different options in regards to hosting companies, i belive the question is asking what website we use for the publication of our webpages. We use GitHub, while the book suggests other options, however i do not know what the advantages and disadventages would be.
    So basically... he went Namecheap.com and bought his domain. Then he went into his dashboard and added the C name and A records to link his domain to GitHub. And he followed these directions "dev.io/pauljwill/connect-github-pages-to-your-namecheap-domain-4gjj"
In my opinion this class has a smaller workload than what the book does, we branch out and do more subjects, but the book goes into greater detail on this specific branch of creating a website.
