    <h1>The Mark I</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<br>
<h3>Sadly there is nothing documented on the MK1 other than it kinda looked like a bomb and it was
    bad. It had all of the problems of the later mk2 and more like the fact that it was a bomb and
    exploded on one of our tests. Without the barrel that was added on the later MK1.1 it could only
    ever move the ball approximately 18cm. The mark 1.1 with barrel attatchment sent the marble flying accross the hallway and hit a door1.</h3>
